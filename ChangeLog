***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-5

Added read for remote as well as local files, following suggested code
from Bi Cheng Wu.

***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-4

Added read for bit arrays with lengths 8, 16, 24, and 32.  Returns these as
unsigned integers.

***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-3

Cleaned up fixed-format logical and integers in header preamble to conform with
standard and GILDAS format

***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-2

Added spaces to addComment and addHistory so comments and history start in
column 11

***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-1

Improved header parser to better deal with comments

***************************
New in FITSio_2.1-0

Added ability to read ASCII tables.

***************************
New in FITSio_1.3-1

New in FITSio_2.0-0

Added options for modifying and editing headers.

***************************
New in FITSio_1.3-1

Added TFORMn type "K" for 64-bit signed integers in readFITSbintable.
	This returns 32-bit integers in array that is twice as long as the
	number of rows in the bintable.

Eliminated parsing on zeroes for character strings in readFITSbintable (a
	bug).

***************************
New in FITSio_1.3-0

Added an option to enter axis data with a data frame (likely a perhaps
	edited version of a readFITS axDat) in writeFITSim and
	writeFITSim16i.  If present, this data frame takes priority over
	entries for individual vectors.
Changed writeFITSim16i to ignore NAs in scaling.

***************************

New in FITSio_1.2-1

Changed dataframe with crval etc. so the strings (e.g. ctype) are not
	converted to factors.  This makes it easier to edit those variable
	names.
Updated comment string in FITS headers that references the software that
	wrote the file.

A. Harris 2012-01-14

***************************

New in FITSio_1.2-0

Fixed readFITS so it can read arrays (images) following a primary hdu that
	itelf specifies an attached array.
Reworked read calculation and method for end-of-block padding.
Added error handling to check for incomplete headers, also an option to
	remove or replace non-printing characters from a header.  This latter
	should be used with caution, as depending on how the characters
	were introduced, this may corrupt the returned data.

***************************

New in FITSio_1.1-0

Fixed parsing in readFITShdr.R to preserve value string when in quotes.
Byproduct for compatibility with existing code is that leading or trailing
	spaces in quoted regions are deleted.
Changed defaults for missing CRPIX, CRVAL, and CDELT from NA to 1 in
	readFITSarray.R

A. Harris 2009-07-11

***************************

New in FITSio_1.0-3

In readFrameFromFITS, changed:
   dataFrame <- c(dataFrame, newFrame)
 to
   dataFrame <- data.frame(c(dataFrame, newFrame))
following E. Neilsen's request
