New in FITSio_1.2-0

Fixed readFITS so it can read arrays (images) following a primary hdu that
	itelf specifies an attached array.
Reworked read calculation and method for end-of-block padding.
Added error handling to check for incomplete headers, also an option to
	remove or replace non-printing characters from a header.  This latter
	should be used with caution, as depending on how the characters
	were introduced, this may corrupt the returned data.

New in FITSio_1.1-0

Fixed parsing in readFITShdr.R to preserve value string when in quotes.
Byproduct for compatibility with existing code is that leading or trailing
	spaces in quoted regions are deleted.
Changed defaults for missing CRPIX, CRVAL, and CDELT from NA to 1 in
	readFITSarray.R

following E. Neilsen's request
