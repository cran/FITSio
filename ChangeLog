New in FITSio_1.1-0

Fixed parsing in readFITShdr.R to preserve value string when in quotes.
Byproduct for compatibility with existing code is that leading or trailing
	spaces in quoted regions are deleted.
Changed defaults for missing CRPIX, CRVAL, and CDELT from NA to 1 in
	readFITSarray.R

   dataFrame <- data.frame(c(dataFrame, newFrame))
following E. Neilsen's request
